Hello world! This is my very first blog post on my new website.

I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences here.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. It's designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name.

Here are some examples:

* List item 1
* List item 2

**Bold text** is easy, and so is *italic text*.

You can even include [links](https://www.google.com).

### Images

To include an image, first, make sure the image file is in the `assets/images/` folder.
Then, use this Markdown: `![Alt text for image](/assets/images/your-image-name.jpg)`
For example, if you have `buriburiza3mon-blog/assets/images/my_cat.jpg`, the markdown would be:
`![My cat](/assets/images/my_cat.jpg)`

Stay tuned for more updates!
