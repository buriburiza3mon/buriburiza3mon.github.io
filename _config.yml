# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that.
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.variable }}.

title: Your Blog Name (e.g., Buriburiza3mon's Musings)
email: your-email@example.com (Optional, or remove)
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Write a short description of your blog here.

url: "https://buriburiza3mon.github.io" # your site's domain
